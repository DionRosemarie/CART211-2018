      <h1> WEEK 6 </h1>
      <h2> The GNU Manifesto by Stallman</h2>

      <p> I think collaboration in work environement is underrated. In school, teachers always value this aspect to help the students develop their sens of team work and see other points of view. It helps to see the subject in a different way and make us think outside of our normal perspective. But when we grow older, we kind of forget that. We close ourself and become more independant. In this point of view, I think the GNU project is interesting and we should put more effort in it. In programmation, sometimes, we can't go further in a project or can't realize what we want to do because we don't have the ressources. We also take codes already existing and change it for our use. This is the base of programmation, so why not make it free and accesible for everyone? Of course it is not everybody that can understand that specific language, but by making it free and open to the world, people can learn by themselve. People who wants to learn it and take advantage of it are going to be the one who are really motivated. I think it is this aspect that make some people want to make it not free. We are in a society where it is super important to gain money and when we have the chance to make some, we will take advantage of it. Why not change that? If people want to collaborate to this project free, why does other people need to involve money in the equation? By making it free, it think more people would be more open to learn about this language and programmation. I think it is like the education system. In our society, we have talented and qualified people that can fully fulfied their ambitions because they don't have the ressources to do so. If we give them what they are missing, imagine what we could get out of it. It is taking a risk by making this project come to lifes, but we need to take one to make people realize that it is possible. We need one change to make them realize it is okay and everything are possible if we just take a leap.

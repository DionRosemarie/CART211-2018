      <h1> WEEK 8 </h1>
      <h2> Mind vs. Machine <br> Brian Christian </h2>

      <p> How can we be sure that we are not robots ourselves? When we think about that specific machine, we see a squared box with a screen and a keyboadr to interact with it. In the view of this article, the computer's use is to have a conversation with another person. To make this possible, the program need to be able to have cultural knowledge, be able to anticipate what can come next etc. So technically, it is the same thing as us. We have cultural knowledge, we anticipate what is going to come next in the conversation. We can't know everything and have the best answer evrytime, just like the computer. Also, the program that is run in the machine is create by the human mind and is suppose to act like one. The creator is giving a part is own in his software. He is also giving a part of our society's mind. If the computer needs to be able to have a conversation, it needs to think like us. <br><br> I think it is super impressive how people at the time of the Turing test had the knowledge and capacity to create such a computer. They did not have all the technologies we have today to make this project possible. Today, we are pushing the limits with artificial intelligence. We have create a full responsive human because of what those contests and research have found. After reading the GNU manifesto and this text, I do believe that programers and software developpers are a great community. It's because of the work of sombedy else that we can advance in our own work. Of course, medecine goes the same way, but I think the competition aspect of the career is not as important. We want to help each other to make progress. </p>

    <h2> ARTISTIC DIRECTION </h2>
<p>For this assignment, I chose a topic that targets teenagers. This website is going to inform parents and their kids about the origin of social media, and in this case the internet, and also about all the negative impact it can have. The visual of this platform needs to be serious, but also dynamic and young to catch the intention of the user. I decided to have followed the trends with can see on most website in 2018. The look is minimalist and has geometric features. The color palette has red to give some energy to the page, blue to give contrast, yellow to compliment the blue and beige to neutralize the three other colors. With those, I can give difference emotions to the pages. For the font, I decided to choose a sans serif one because it looks and feels younger. I had brackets on each corner of the page to feel like a camera framing. This is a simple way to make a reminder to social media. I have point texture to add dimension and life to the composition. Because this subject comes with a lot of information and statistic, I incorporated an infographic on the third page of the website. This a fun way to learn about this subject because we retain more information by seeing it than reading it. </p>

    <h2> THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON TEENAGERS <br> ESSAY AND RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT</h2>
    <p>We can easily guess the answer if we ask people under 18 if they can remember a time without internet. This magical invention goes back to the 1950s with the development of electronic computers. However, it is only in the 1990s that the internet had a severe impact on culture, commerce, technology, and communication. Nowadays, the teenager cannot imagine not being able to use the internet while someone was on the phone or just going to the library to do their research. In 1993, only 1% of global communication was communicated on the Internet. It went up to 51% in the 2000s and went further up with 97% only seven years later. The creation of this new way of communication and information changed our life quickly. Today we can access it on our smartphone wherever we are. Some debates are going on the negative impact of this invention on the youth, especially teenagers. Social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others can have a significant impact on their mental development and self-esteem. The creation of the Internet, and in this perspective the social media, is a blessing in disguise.<br><br>

    In the early 70 and 80’s, thinking of a computer was pretty boring. Someone sitting in front of a keyboard all day long alone was not the most exciting thing to do we could think of. However, it is because of people like them, also know as geeks, that we have social media today. It all started with the Bulletin Board Systeme. People could access this central system to download files, games and communicate with other users. Following this system, people started to use CompuServe, which allowed users to share files, news, and events, but the most important thing: real interaction. People could now send a direct message to someone, or be part of a forum and talk to thousand other people. This was the birth of online communication that we know today. One thing was missing, and it was the possibility to create your profile. Classmates.com offered this possibility, and now people could track down their friends from high school or their crush they never forgot. We jump in time to 2003 were MySpace made its debut. Specially created for teens, the site offer music, music videos and other funky features that we could not find on any other sites. MySpace lost his popularity when students from Harvard’s University launched Facebook to the general public in 2006. His ease of use and new features made him a social media favorites. With this success, the company developed other application like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. <br><br>

    That we like it or not, social media is everywhere around us and we cannot escape it. It is the easiest way to communicate with people, go to events and post pictures of us. Because it is now part of our culture, teens between as early as nine years old to seventeen are on those media. The human brain at this particular time is developing the prefrontal cortex which is the decision-making part. In other words, young adults cannot make decision correctly and can be easily influenced by what is surrounding them or what they see. This is where social media can be a dangerous source of information for them. As a kid, you do not wonder about your popularity, your appearance and whether or not you are going out on Friday night. The brain between the age of nine to seventeen is going through the same phase as the brain of a 0 to 3 years old. Parents do not think they need to monitor their child phones because they are old enough to have them. Most of them feel depress and left out scrolling down their app. During puberty, teenagers are more vulnerable than adults and have greater sensibility. A study from the Clinical Psychological Science journal said that in 2015, 36% of the interrogated teens reported that they were feeling desperately sad or hopeless, or think about, planning or attempting suicide. According to the statistics of guarchild.com, 88%of teens interrogated have seen someone be mean or cruel to another person on a social media networking site. Social media are not as harmless as they look. Most users of those apps are minors. They are fragile and can’t protect themselves from the hate online. We can not forbid them to use social media, but we can talk to them to avoid the worst. <br><br>

    It is a shared opinion that the creation of the internet changed our lives for the best. In the instant of a click, on our back jeans pocket, we have access to an infinite number of resources. Furthermore, we can reconnect with a long lost friend or someone on the other side of the planet. We can also share pictures, our thoughts on many subjects and enjoy videos of an event going on somewhere. Most people would not be able to go on with their day without internet, and in this optic, social media. We spend at least 2 to 3 hours a day on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other apps. As an adult, we can judge what is right and wrong online. It is not the same case for teenagers. They are vulnerable and can’t make the right choice because their brain is going through hormonal changes that affect their decision-making skills. As beautiful as it is, social media a dangerous platform for them. We need to sensibilise them more about the danger that goes on with having an account on one of those. With the right information and guidance from an adult or parent, social networks can be used and appreciated for the better.
